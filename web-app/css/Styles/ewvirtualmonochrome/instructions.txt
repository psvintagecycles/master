 The body section has been defined as an editable region. You can make changes here on each page. 
 To make "site wide" changes, simply open Templates/project.dwt and make your changes there for the headers, footers and navigation.
 On saving the template, you will be given the option to update all pages in your site with the changes.
 
All the font, backgrounds, colors etc. can be edited in the file style.css. This file is commented with a note about which part of the layout the code refers to.

You can add extra CSS but it's best to back up style.css before making any changes.
